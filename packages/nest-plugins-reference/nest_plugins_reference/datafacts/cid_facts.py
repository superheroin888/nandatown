"""Content-addressed DataFacts plugin with provenance and signed freshness.

The reference plugin (:class:`~nest_plugins_reference.datafacts.datafacts_v1.DataFactsV1`)
addresses datasets by the publisher's *chosen name* and checks freshness with an
unauthenticated wall-clock read. Both are silently exploitable:

* **Substitution** — republish different content under the same name; nothing
  rejects it, every existing holder of the URL is now pointed at new bytes.
* **Stale-claim** — "freshness" only means *some* publish touched this name
  recently, by anyone, with no proof the content was actually re-validated.
* **Provenance washing** — there is no field linking a derived dataset back to
  the dataset(s) it was built from, so a contamination trail vanishes at the
  first hop.

This plugin fixes all three by construction:

* The URL **is** ``df://sha256-<hex>``, a hash of the dataset's content-bearing
  fields. Two different contents cannot collide on one URL; the same content
  always resolves to the same URL (republishing is idempotent).
* A derived dataset lists its lineage in ``dataset.metadata["parents"]`` (a
  list of parent URLs); :meth:`CidFacts.publish` rejects any parent hash it has
  not itself seen published.
* Every successful publish issues a :class:`FreshnessProof`: the publisher's
  identity-layer key signs ``(url, tick)`` over a logical tick counter (never
  ``time.time()``, so Tier 1 stays deterministic). :meth:`verify_freshness`
  only accepts a proof whose signature both verifies *and* was produced by the
  dataset's declared owner — an outsider re-publishing identical bytes under
  someone else's name cannot manufacture a valid freshness claim for them.

Example::

    identity = DidKeyIdentity(AgentId("supplier-0"), seed=b"sim-seed")
    facts = CidFacts(identity)
    url = await facts.publish(DatasetMetadata(name="raw", owner=AgentId("supplier-0")))
    assert await facts.verify_freshness(url) is True
